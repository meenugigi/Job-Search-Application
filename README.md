CS50 FINAL PROJECT

This application makes use of Django, Javascript and MySQL database.
(note: javacript is written within the required HTML files)

This is a jobsearch application named 'JobHunt' that supports multiple user-types. 
In this application we have 2 types on users. 
Type 1: WebUsers (they are any users who log into the application to search jobs).
Type 2: Employers (they are people who log into the application to register their companies on the application and hire people).
To support mutiple user type, I have used view decorators, Djangoâ€™s built-in permissions framework, to acheive this functionality.


Features of this application

- 2 types of users can create accounts. 
	Type 1 --> Users (searchng for jobs)
	Type 2 --> Employers (hiring users)

- Employers can fill forms to register their companies on the website. The registered details will be visible to other employers as well as users.

- Users can search companies by typing in the company name on the search bar.

- Users can see a list of all companies registered. Clicking on a company will display all details related to that particular company. Any previous ratings provided for that company will also be displayed along with the average ratings for that company.

- Users can give ratingd to any company. These ratings will ve visible to all other users as well as employers.

- Users will be able to send applications to any companies registered on the website.
Users will be able to upload their resumes while filling up their application forms. On succesfully submitting the applications, users will receive an email.

- Employers will be able to view applications receieved only for their companies.

- Employers can update or delete the company details registered by them. Employers will not have access to update or delete information related to companies registered by other employers.
